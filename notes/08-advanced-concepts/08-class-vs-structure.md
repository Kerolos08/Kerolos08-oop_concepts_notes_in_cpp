# What is the difference between Class and Structure

## C++ and C languages

- In **C**, `struct` can only contain data.
- In **C++**, `struct` is upgraded: it supports everything a `class` can do (methods, constructors, inheritance, etc.).

## Main Difference between classes and objects in c++

|  | Structure | Class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keyword | struct | class |
| Default | public | private |
| Purpose | Generally for grouping data | Data abstraction and more OOP features |
- Structs and classes in C++ are both **value types**; they can be created on stack or heap.
- Structs support **all constructor types**, same as classes.
- Use a struct for simple data, use a class when behavior/logic is needed.
