# What is OOP

### **FA (Function Programming) vs OOP (Object Oriented Programming)**

FA (Function Programming) 

Is a programming style that depending on chop the problem or the program into smaller function each of them has one function only.

That means in big projects you may have over a 1000 functions, but this is not the problem.

The problem is with organizing them and the way you look at them.

### OOP came to solve this problem for us.

It came to change the way you look to your code and make it as same as looking to your life.

Those unlimited function goes under their objects as in OOP we dealing with objects .

Any Function in a class called method.
