# Constructors

### Rules About OOP

- Don’t create an **Empty** object, at least it should have **initial values.**
- **OOP** give you the advantage to make the user of the classes **doing your rules** when he use them.

### **Constructors**

- A **constructor** is a **special member function** of a class that is **automatically invoked** when an object of the class is created.

### **special member function**

- A **special member function i**s a function that is **automatically generated by the compiler** under certain conditions **unless you define it yourself**.

### Why Are Constructors Called Special?

**Constructors are special because:**

1. **Automatic Invocation**
    
    They are called automatically when an object is created — you don't call them manually like other functions.
    
2. **Compiler-Generated**
    
    If you don’t define a constructor, the compiler may generate a default or copy constructor for you.
    
3. **No Return Type**
    
    Unlike normal functions, constructors don't have a return type, not even `void`.
    

### **Constructor Characteristics**

- Same name as the class.
- No return type (not even `void`).
- Can be **overloaded**.
- Used to initialize member variables.

### **Example with no** **constructor (Default):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class clsAddress
{
private:
    string _AddressLine1;
    string _AddressLine2;
    string _POBox;
    string _ZipCode;

public:
		**// No Constructor!!!**
    void SetAddressLine1(string AddressLine1)
    {
        _AddressLine1 = AddressLine1;
    }
    string AddressLine1()
    {
        return _AddressLine1;
    }
    void SetAddressLine2(string AddressLine2)
    {
        _AddressLine2 = AddressLine2;
    }
    string AddressLine2()
    {
        return _AddressLine2;
    }
    void SetPOBox(string POBox)
    {
        _POBox = POBox;
    }
    string PoBox()
    {
        return _POBox;
    }
    void SetZipCode(string ZipCode)
    {
        _ZipCode = ZipCode;
    }
    string ZipCode()
    {
        return _ZipCode;
    }
    void PrintAddress()
    {
        cout << "\nAddress Details:\n";
        cout << "------------------------";
        cout << "\nAddressLine1: " << _AddressLine1 << endl;
        cout << "AddressLine2: " << _AddressLine2 << endl;
        cout << "POBox       : " << _POBox << endl;
        cout << "ZipCode     : " << _ZipCode << endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    clsAddress Address1;
    Address1.PrintAddress();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example there is no constructor so what happened depending on the constructor proprietaries:

- The compiler **invoked a constructor** that assigning the initial values for the (non primitive type) like `string` which is `“”` , but in primitive type `int` , `float` it not giving them value as if it gave them value it would be a garbage random values but its playing a more critical job:
    - Ensures proper initialization.
    - Triggers in-class initializers (making sure that every variable is assigned to its value in class).
    - Handles memory setup and inheritance (if applicable).
    
    So we can say this empty generated constructor is ensuring that the program running well.
    

### Example with a user defined constructor:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class clsAddress
{
private:
    string _AddressLine1;
    string _AddressLine2;
    string _POBox;
    string _ZipCode;

public:
    clsAddress (string AddressLine1, string AddressLine2, string POBox, string ZipCode)
    {
        _AddressLine1 = AddressLine1;
        _AddressLine2 = AddressLine2;
        _POBox = POBox;
        _ZipCode = ZipCode;
    }
    void SetAddressLine1(string AddressLine1)
    {
        _AddressLine1 = AddressLine1;
    }
    string AddressLine1()
    {
        return _AddressLine1;
    }
    void SetAddressLine2(string AddressLine2)
    {
        _AddressLine2 = AddressLine2;
    }
    string AddressLine2()
    {
        return _AddressLine2;
    }
    void SetPOBox(string POBox)
    {
        _POBox = POBox;
    }
    string PoBox()
    {
        return _POBox;
    }
    void SetZipCode(string ZipCode)
    {
        _ZipCode = ZipCode;
    }
    string ZipCode()
    {
        return _ZipCode;
    }
    void PrintAddress()
    {
        cout << "\nAddress Details:\n";
        cout << "------------------------";
        cout << "\nAddressLine1: " << _AddressLine1 << endl;
        cout << "AddressLine2: " << _AddressLine2 << endl;
        cout << "POBox       : " << _POBox << endl;
        cout << "ZipCode     : " << _ZipCode << endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    clsAddress Address1("Queen Alia Street","B 303 ","11192","5555");
    Address1.PrintAddress();

    return 0;
}

```

- It runs **automatically** before any other code when the object is created.
- This **constructor** is Running **automatically** before any method or any order in the class when the object is **created** so we can use it in many ways.
- In this example we **override** the default constructor to force the user to enter the full address data when he is going to use the class to ensure that he is not going to create an **empty object.**
- The **default constructor is No Longer Available** so if the user tried to create an empty class depending on the default one that would be invoked by the compiler will lead to an **error**.
- There is a ton of uses of this constructor like:
- There is a ton of uses of this constructor like:
    - Initialize variables.
    - Require mandatory input.
    - Overloaded constructors.
    - Copy/Move constructors…
    - Initialization list…
    - Restrict creation…
    - File or DB-based init.
    - Delegation…
    - Logging or debugging…
    - Custom validation…
