# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

**Course 10: OOP as it Should Be - Concepts** + **Sub Projects from Course 11: OOP Applications** from Dr. Mohamed Abu-Hadhoud (Programming Advices) fundamentals roadmap.

This repository contains my comprehensive notes, code examples, reusable libraries, and projects from learning Object-Oriented Programming concepts and applications in C++.


## 📊 Progress

**Total Topics Covered:** 51+ OOP concepts  
**Reusable Libraries Built:** 6 libraries  
**Projects Completed:** 4 major projects  
**Exercises Solved:** 3+ practical exercises

## 📚 What's Covered

### Core OOP Principles

* ✅ **Abstraction** - Hiding complexity and showing only essential features
* ✅ **Encapsulation** - Bundling data and methods that work on that data
* ✅ **Inheritance** - Creating new classes from existing ones
* ✅ **Polymorphism** - Objects taking many forms through virtual functions

### Key Concepts

* Classes and Objects
* Access Specifiers (Public, Private, Protected)
* Properties (Getters/Setters)
* Constructors & Destructors
* Copy Constructors
* Static Members & Functions
* Friend Classes & Functions
* Virtual Functions & Interfaces
* Multi-level Inheritance
* Up/Down Casting
* The `this` Pointer
* Objects with Arrays & Vectors
* Nested Classes
* Separate Class Libraries

## 💡 Major Projects

### 1. Calculator Application
A simple calculator class demonstrating basic OOP principles with encapsulation and methods.

### 2. String Class Library
Custom string manipulation library built from scratch, showcasing class design and operator overloading concepts.

### 3. Date Class Library
Comprehensive date handling library with validation, calculations, and formatting - demonstrating real-world OOP application.

### 4. Period Class Library
Time period management class building upon the Date Library.

### 5. Utility Class Library
Custom utility class with random number generation, character manipulation, array operations, encryption, and number-to-text conversion.

### 6. Input validation Class Library
Custom input validation library for reading and validating different data types (int, float, double, date) with range checking.
